Hi 👋 My name is Reuben Rapose
==============================

Builder at heart. Engineer by trade.
-----------------------------------

I design and ship systems at the intersection of **backend infra, Rust, and Web3**.  

Currently: deep-diving into **Solana development** while stacking proof-of-work across fellowships, hackathons, and production-grade projects.

What I’ve worked on:
- **Rust**: Indexers, MPC flows, custom backends.  
- **Infra**: Scaling workloads across **AWS, GCP, and Azure** (CI/CD, networking, IAM, orchestration).  
- **Web2**: **TypeScript/React** applications, SaaS tooling, and scalable full-stack experiences.  
- **Leadership**: Tech Lead at Wanderlust (Tokyo) — led distributed teams, delivered AI/ML-backed systems for enterprise clients, and handled infra at scale.  
- **Academia**: Visiting Faculty at NMIMS University (Mumbai), teaching *Introduction to Modern App Development* to 3rd Year Data Science students.  
- **Community**: Featured on [100xDev podcast](https://youtu.be/AcZvdcvx1Ro?si=0gJslT4DZw4WlxxE) discussing my journey and insights.

What I’m doing now:
- 🦀 Writing a lot of **Rust** (indexers, pipelines, Solana dev).  
- ⚡ Exploring **Solana/Web3** through the **Superdevs Fellowship** + **Turbine Q4**.  
- 🛠️ Attending **OnlyDevs** & **Solana Apex** to learn, share, and connect.  
- 🌍 Based in Mumbai, India.  

> My philosophy: **stop comparing, play your hand.** Every stage of life comes with unique advantages — I build by doubling down on mine.
